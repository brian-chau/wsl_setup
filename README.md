# C++ on WSL2 with VS Code and CMake

This is an example of how to use:
* Install Ubuntu in WSL2
* Setting up Visual Studio Code for GCC compiler for C++ applications

## Setting up WSL2

0. Removing old installations of WSL2 distributions
    1. Open your "Start" menu and search for "Settings" and start the "Settings" app.
    2. Under "Apps", select "Apps & features"
    3. Under "App list", in the "Search apps" field, type the name of the distribution that you installed in the first step (e.g. ubuntu)
    4. Click the three vertical dots icon to the far right of the distribution, and click Uninstall.


1. Install WSL
    1. Start "Command Prompt"
    2. Run `wsl --set-default-version 2`

2. Install Ubuntu 22
    1. In the Start menu, open the Microsoft Store, and search for Ubuntu 22.
    2. Select the item called "Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS" and click "Install."
    3. Click "Open" to launch the command prompt and start the installation process.
        * If you encounter an error that says `There has been an error`, log out and log back in, and try again.
        * If you encounter an error that says `Failed to attach disk 'C:\Users\....\ext4.vhdx' to WSL2: The system cannot find the file` then do the following:
            1. Launch a new command prompt window by pressing `Ctrl+R`, then typing `cmd`
            2. Type `wsl --list` to find the distribution that used to be installed.
            3. Type `wslconfig /u <name of distribution that used to be installed>` to unlink the distribution.
            4. Return to the Windows Store to try again.
    4. When prompted for the initial account credentials, enter your Windows account username as your username, so that your Linux username will match your Windows username.
    5. Enter a password, and confirm the password.

3. Start WSL
    1. Press Ctrl+R
    2. Type `wsl`
    3. Press Enter
    4. If you see a popup that says this:
        * ![Error message](wsl_error_msg.png)
        * Right click on the title bar of the WSL command window > Settings.
        * In the bottom left hand corner, click "Open JSON file"
        * Scroll down to "profiles" JSON item, and find the "defaults" sub-item in there.
            * This will open the "settings.json" file.
        * Under the "profiles > list" item, copy the settings for "wsl"
            * For example, this might look like
                ```
                "default": {},
                "list":
                [
                    ...
                    {
                        "guid": "{<some-ascii-hex-string-separated-by-underscores>}",
                        "hidden": false,
                        "name": "Ubuntu-22.04",
                        "source": "Windows.Terminal.Wsl"
                    },
                    ...
                ]
                ```
            * Copy it so it looks like
                ```
                "default": {
                    "guid": "{<some-ascii-hex-string-separated-by-underscores>}",
                    "hidden": false,
                    "name": "Ubuntu-22.04",
                    "source": "Windows.Terminal.Wsl"
                },
                "list":
                [
                    ...
                    {
                        "guid": "{<some-ascii-hex-string-separated-by-underscores>}",
                        "hidden": false,
                        "name": "Ubuntu-22.04",
                        "source": "Windows.Terminal.Wsl"
                    },
                    ...
                ]
                ```

4. Fix the command line path name.
    1. Edit the ~/.bashrc file.
        * At the top of the file, paste the following code snippet, where <current_directory> is the name of the
          mount point shown in the console window (e.g. "/mnt/c/Users/`username`")
            ```
            if [[ $PWD == /mnt/c/Users/$USER ]]; then
              cd /home/$USER/user
            else
              case $PWD/ in
                /mnt/c/Users/$USER/*)
                  without_prefix=${PWD#/mnt/c/Users/$USER/}
                  cd /home/$USER/user/user/$without_prefix
                  ;;
              esac
            fi
            ```
    2. Look for the line that says `if [ "$color_prompt" = yes ]; then`
        * In the following line, remove the part that specifies the username "\u" and the host name "\h"
        * Do the same for the "else" block.
        * For example, it might look like this:
            ```
            if [ "$color_prompt" = yes ]; then
                PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
            else
                PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
            fi
            ```
        * Change it to this:
            ```
            if [ "$color_prompt" = yes ]; then
                PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
            else
                PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\w\$ '
            fi
            ```
        * Also remove the `\u@\h` details from the title bar
            ```
            case "$TERM" in
            xterm*|rxvt*)
                PS1="\[\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h: \w\a\]$PS1"
                ;;
            *)
                ;;
            esac
            ```
        * Change it to this:
            ```
            case "$TERM" in
            xterm*|rxvt*)
                PS1="\[\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\w\a\]$PS1"
                ;;
            *)
                ;;
            esac
            ```
    3. Save and exit.
    4. In the bash terminal, type the following commands:
        ```
        cd
        mkdir user
        ln -s /mnt/c/Users/$USER ~/user/user
        ```
    5. Restart `wsl`.

5. Update the system
    ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt autoremove --purge
    ```

6. Add custom aliases to `~/.bash_aliases`
    ```
    alias cls="printf '\ec'; history -c"
    alias nanos="nano -c -ET4"
    alias ii="explorer.exe"
    ```

7. Install gcc-12 and g++-12.
    1. Restart WSL.
    2. Run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
    3. Run `sudo apt install g++-12 gcc-12 build-essential`
